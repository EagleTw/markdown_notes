# How to write specs

Goal

- Improve create, review, use specs
- Articulate your idea

## Introduction

- Writing is critical in waterflow or agile
- May projects fail because they do no specify properly what the system should do. In fact may projects have just ... a vague notion of what the system should do.

## Lesson 1: The need of writing specs

Vague spec costs a lot of $$.

The goal of problem is to communicat problem and solution clearly.

Make spec easy to understand.

## Lesson 2: Types of specs and their audiences

| Types            | Purpose                      | Audiences                           | Writer             |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Requirement Spec | What is needed and why?      | CAE, QA&PV, RD, Marketing, Mgt.Core | CAE, RD, Marketing |
| Funcitonal Spec  | How to meet the requirements | CAE, QA&PV, RD, Marketing, Mgt.Core | RD,                |
| Design Spec      | How to implement it?         | CAE, QA&PV, RD, Mgt.Core            | RD,                |
| Test plan (spec) | Does it works?               | CAE, QA&PV, RD, Mgt.Core            | CAE, QA&PV, RD     |

Always consider Audiences (Write out your audience)

- Who
- What should does the audiendce need?
- How to I write?

## Lesson 3: A structured approach to edit specs (Spec templates)

- Start with spec templates in sharepoint
- How detail should the spec need

  | detailed                 | short             |
  | ------------------------ | ----------------- |
  | new product              | added feature     |
  | mutil-company            | one RD one tester |
  | long dev time            | few days          |
  | High risks               | little risks      |
  | with other parts of code | independent code  |

- If the sections is not needed, just type: N/A, or remove it
- **Do not use old specs as template as new specs**
  - Use spec templates

## Lesson 4: Proof-reading your specs
