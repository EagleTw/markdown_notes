## Programming Introduction

### What is a computer?

* Definition

  > A computer is a programmable device that stores, retrieves, and processes data. The term "computer" was originally given to humans (human computers) who performed numerical calculations using mechanical calculators, such as the abacus and slide rule. The term was later given to mechanical devices as they began replacing human computers. Today's computers are electronic devices that accept data (input), process that data, produce output, and store (storage) the results (IPOS).

### What is programming?

* "Programming is like building a world from atoms"

### Ok! What is atom?

* Code (Text) is the atom
* If else 


## Hands on

### Environment

* What is python
* Open vs code
* Terminal
* Run python3 in raw

### Excercise 1 - Hello World

* Know develop flow
* Goal know print
* Start to read debugging message

```python3
print("Hello world")
```

### Excercise 2 - Type and Identifier


```python3

a = 0;
b = 1.0
c = "Hello"

print("Type:", type(a), type(b), type(c))
```

### Excercise 3 - Simple Calculator

* `type()`
* Data + Operand


### Excercise 4 - Try it yourself
